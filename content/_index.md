# Arcion Documentation

Arcion is the modern real-time enterprise database replication made simple. We have engineered Arcion using a distributed in-memory architecture to deliver correctness, scalability, and resilience.

Arcion supports a variety of single and distributed OLTP and OLAP sources and targets. The design is tailored for OLTP to distributed OLAP replication. 

You can use Arcion in a number of ways:

- A YAML-driven CLI
- A workflow-guided UI
- An API

Arcion empowers you to set up production-ready pipelines in a way that suits your needs, whether you choose self-managed on-premises deployments or fully-managed Arcion Cloud services.
